1. class NativeExample {
2. native void doSomethingLocal(int i);
3.
4. static {
5. System.loadLibrary(“MyNativeLib”);
6. }
7. }

Notice the native declaration on line 2, which declares that the code that implements doSomethingLocal() resides in a local library. Lines 4–6 are static initializer code, so they are executed at the time that class NativeExample is loaded; this ensures that the library will be available by the time somebody needs it.

Callers of native methods do not have to know that the method is native. The call is made in exactly the same way as if it were non-native:
1. NativeExample natex;
2. natex = new NativeExample();
3. natex.doSomethingLocal(5);
